## Problem
Teachers face significant challenges in evaluating the diverse cognitive and motivational characteristics of their students. Traditional methods such as surveys, observations, and reports vary in effectiveness and often fail to provide objective, real-time insights. Studies indicate that teacher-student relationships and positive teacher behavior have a substantial impact on student engagement. However, without accurate engagement assessments, optimizing teaching methods remains difficult.

## Solution
ThinkSync leverages computer vision and audio analysis to assess student engagement, providing teachers with real-time insights into classroom focus and participation. Our platform generates a personalized attention breakdown, helping educators identify the most effective teaching strategies for their students.

## How It Works
ThinkSync employs cutting-edge technology to analyze classroom engagement through:
- **Movement Tracking**: Monitors student motion to detect engagement levels and flags anomalies.
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and tracks students for personalized engagement metrics.
- **Audio Analysis**: Records and evaluates speech patterns to generate an average confidence score.

## Features
- **Real-Time Engagement Metrics**: Provides instant feedback on student focus levels.
- **Personalized Attention Breakdown**: Tracks individual student behavior over time.
- **Teaching Method Optimization**: Helps educators identify the most effective instructional techniques.
